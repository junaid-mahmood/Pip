# Pip - Desk Assistant

A little assistant that sits on your desk with a bunch of features to help you (will have some nice idle animations :) )


## What will it be able to do?

I'm building Pip to handle the everyday stuff:
- Show time and weather at a glance
- Display notifications from my calendar and important apps
- Play Spotify without reaching for my phone
- Respond to basic voice commands 
- Take quick voice notes when inspiration strikes

Basically, all the stuff I check my phone for 100 times a day but right there on my desk.

## The Build

Raspberry Pi 3B+ with a tiny 3.5" touchscreen that sits right on top of the GPIO pins. Super clean, no extra cables for the display. I added a few rotary encoders ( sometimes I don't want to talk out loud to change the volume or brightness)
For audio, I'm using an Anker Soundcore 2 speaker because it's durable and has wireless capabilities plus an inbuilt microphone. All inside of a custom 3d case
