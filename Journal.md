Total Time: 14h

# June 8: Research

Project research and brainstormed possible project directions

Explored existing builds and creative ideas for inspiration

Listed potential themes: smart assistants, IoT builds, cars/drones

Time: 1 hr

# June 9: PIP 

Researched materials needed for the project

Checked hardware compatibility and integration possibilities

Compared components 

Time: 2.5 hr


  # June 11: Started to build the CAD MODEL 

Had no idea how constraints worked, kept making sketches that looked fine but wouldn't extrude

Went through 2 design iterations because my first attempt was way too complicated

Modeling the potentiometer took forever

Found this macropad on Amazon that gave me good inspiration for the layout

 used a macropad i found on amazon as a inspiration for the idea
